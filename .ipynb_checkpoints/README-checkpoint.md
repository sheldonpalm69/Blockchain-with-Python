# Blockchain Wallet in Python
This example takes you through the steps needed to create a "universal" wallet that supports many different cryptocurrencies. With this wallet you can manage all addresses across hundreds of different coins.  Specifically, an Ethereum and Bitcoin Testnet are generated in this example.

## Dependencies:
- PHP must be installed on your operating system (any version, 5 or 7).
- You will need to clone the hd-wallet-derive tool.
- bit Python Bitcoin library.
- web3.py Python Ethereum library.

## Steps to Generate Blockchain Wallet in Python:

1. Create a project directory called wallet and cd into it.

2. Clone the hd-wallet-derive tool into this folder and install it using the instructions on its README.md.

3. Create a symlink called derive for the hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php script into the top level project directory like so: ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive

4. Test that you can run the ./derive script properly, use one of the examples on the repo's README.md

5. Create a file called wallet.py -- this will be your universal wallet script.  My final wallet.py file is located above in the "wallet" folder, but here is a snippet of the beginning of my wallet.py file:

6. Setup Constants:

At this point, I followed the rest of the instructions to flesh out my wallet.py file and include everything it needed, including the functions, the variables, etc.

### Send some transactions!
Ran into some hardware issues and was unable to proceed. 


### Local PoA Ethereum Transaction:
Ran into some hardware issues and was unable to proceed. 

Due to repetitive attempts many screens shot were missed.
